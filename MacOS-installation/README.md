Instructions for installing Python on a Mac computer
====================================================

As I don't have a Mac computer I can't include screen shots to show how the process works. Here are links to a couple of websites which give instructions.

Mac computers in the past have had the older Python version Python 2 already installed, but programmers now use Python 3, which has a lot of new commands, so it is preferable to install Python 3 as described. (From MacOS version 10.15 onwards Python 2 is *no longer* installed.)

The instructions on these websites involve using the Mac program called *Terminal*. Here are instructions on how to open Terminal.

### How to open Terminal on a Mac

The Terminal app is in the Utilities folder in Applications. To open it, either open your Applications folder, then open Utilities and double-click on Terminal, or press Command - spacebar to launch Spotlight and type "Terminal," then double-click the search result.

You'll see a small window with a white background open on your desktop. In the title bar are your username, the word "bash" and the dimensions of the window in pixels.

If you want to make the window bigger, click on the bottom right corner and drag it outwards. If you don't like the black text on a white background, go to the Shell menu, choose New Window and select from the options in the list.

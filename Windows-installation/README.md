# Options for Windows installation

There are two main options:

## Full Python installation

 This option involves downloading the Python installation file from Python's home website at www.python.org.

 The full Python installation comes with a Python editor called IDLE, which is fairly basic. It allows you to write and test Python code, but lacks some of the helpful features found with other code editors.

 It is very common to install a better code editor to use with your full Python installation, and these instructions show how you can add and use the *Visual Studio Code* editor.

## Python installation combined with a dedicated Python editor

There are a couple of options where you choose a dedicated Python code editor, and it comes packaged with its own version of Python. This takes the pain out of actually installing the Python code. The link below shows how you can install the *mu* editor for Python coding.

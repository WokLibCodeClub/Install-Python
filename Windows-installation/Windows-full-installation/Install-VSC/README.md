# Installing and Using *Visual Studio Code*

We have sometimes abbreviated *Visual Studio Code* to *VSC* in this page.

## Installing the *Visual Studio Code* editor

How to find, download and install the latest version of *Visual Studio Code*:

* Go to the [download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads)

![Download options](Images/VSC-1.png "Downloads")

and select the version for your operating system.

For Windows you should know from doing the Python installation whether your system is 32-bit or 64-bit. Choose **User Installer** if you are the only user on your computer, or if other users don't want to use *Visual Studio Code*; choose **System Installer** if you want all users on your computer to be able to use *Visual Studio Code*.

Save the downloaded file to your computer, and double-click on the file to run the installation.

## Setting up *Visual Studio Code*

Watch the introductory video at
* [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics)

which shows you the programme window and gives an example of writing Python code in the editor.

## Using *Visual Studio Code*

When you are creating your own Python projects you will find it is a very good plan to create a *separate folder* for each project you work on. In the project folder you can put any Python code you write, but also images or sound files as well as any other background information which helps you with your project.

If you have your Python project in its own folder there is a *very good* way to access your project in *Visual Studio Code*. Open the ```File``` menu and choose the open ```Open Folder...``` and navigate to your project folder. You can now use the *VSC* explorer pane by clicking on the top left icon:

which enables you to see all the files in your project folder.

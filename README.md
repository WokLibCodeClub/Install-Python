# Install Python on your own computer

You may have been writing Python code *online* using a website like [trinket](https://trinket.io/) but sooner or later you will find sites like this have limitations and don't allow you to use the full range of Python functions. To get access to the full Python language you will need to have Python installed on your own computer. This section contains instructions for installing Python3 on your own computer.

The instructions below are for installations on Windows computers and Mac/Apple computers. The Windows instructions are more detailed because the person writing them uses Windows computers!

We will improve the instructions for Mac/Apple computers when we find out more about them!

* [Go to Windows installation instructions](Windows-installation)

## A note about Python2 and Python3

Python has been around since 1991 and has had various versions since then. The most recent version is Python3, which came out in 2008, and this is the version you should install on your computer. The previous version, Python2, which came out in 2000, is very different from Python3, and many of the common functions work in a different way between Python2 and Python3.

The problem is that there is a great deal of material still on the internet which describes how to do coding using Python2. If you are using the internet to get help with your coding, you need to be careful to make sure you are looking at *Python3* examples. Some webpages will make this clear, but not every one will. A good tip, when you are doing an internet search, is to include the term "Python3" in your search string.
